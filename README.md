# CPS530-Assignments
A collection of websites I built for the CPS530 Web Systems Development course at Toronto Metropolitan University.
Each main website file should contain a comment with an HTML link to the corresponding website, and should all be hosted on the TMU CS server, as well as being publically accessible.
