# CPS530-Assignments
A collection of websites I built for the CPS530 Web Systems Development course at Toronto Metropolitan University.
Each main website file should contain a comment with an HTML link to the corresponding website, and should all be hosted on the TMU CS server, as well as being publically accessible.
If they don't have a comment, or the comment is wrong, the website should be accessible by substituting the X in the link below with the desired file title.

All of these assignments received a 100% grading for their respective assignment.
Some of the ones I would like to highlight include:
