			<h2> Taking the Weekly Quizzes </h2>
			<p> This section of the CMN300 FAQ will focus on the weekly quizzes you will take throughout the course. Content covered includes how to access and start each quiz, quiz formatting, time restrictions, and where to find the content corresponding to each quiz.</p>
			<p> The "Academic Integrity Office" refresher quiz (available week 1) will be used as an example for demonstration purposes, however it should be noted that the actual quizzes are formatted differently and as such, should NOT be used as a reference for exactly how the quizzes will be.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Accessing/Starting Quizzes</h2>
		<p>There are two ways to access the weekly quizzes: from the quizzes section of your D2L homepage for CMN300, and from each week's content topics. </p>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b>How do I find the quizzes in the quiz section?</b> </summary>
			<h3 style="margin-left:2px;">For accessing via the quiz section, from your CMN300 homepage:</h3>
			<p class=instruction>1. Click on the "Assesment" tab, then click "Quizzes." (Fig 1)</p>
			<p class=instruction>2. You will see a list of available quizzes. Click on the one you wish to start (Academice integrity refresher used as demonstration). (Fig 2)</p>
			<p class=instruction>3. You'll be brought to a page that will give you details on the quiz, including what it will cover, your time limit, and attempts remaining. Clicking the blue "Start Quiz" button at the bottom will start the quiz immediately. (Fig 3)</p>

		<h2>What to expect on each quiz (Quiz Formats)</h2>
		<p>Each quiz is formatted in the same way, so you won't need to expect any drastic differences from week to week. </p>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> How many questions will be on each quiz? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> Weekly quizzes will contain exactly 10 questions. </p>

			<summary> <b> What types of questions will be on each quiz? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> Quiz questions will mainly be <b> multiple choice</b>. You will generally have 4 options to select from to answer any given question. True/false questions may also appear, which give you a statement and ask you to determine if it is true or false.</p>
		</details>
		</div>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b>What will it look like when I am taking the quiz?</b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> The following image is a screenshot of what taking the Academic Integrity refresher quiz looks like. <b>Remember, this quiz should not be used as a direct reference for what the actual weekly quizzes will look like.</b></p>
			<p class=instruction> If you want to know what kinds of questions will be on the quizzes, look at the above question regarding the types of questions that'll appear on each quiz.</p>

		<hr>
		<h2>What restrictions are in place (Time limits, due dates, open/closed book, etc.)</h2>
		<p>Each quiz has a set time limit on how long you have to complete them, as well as a date you must complete it by for marks.</p>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> How long will I have to complete each quiz? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> Although each quiz should only take about 20 minutes to complete, <b>you are given 90 minutes</b> to complete each quiz, starting as soon as you click the "start quiz" button.</p>
			<p class=instruction> The academic integrity quiz does not have such time limit, so it only displays the estimated time you should take. In the actual quizzes, this will be replaced with the time you have remaining.</p>
			<fig>
				<img src="quizscreenshottime.png" alt="in-quiz picture" class="picture">
				<figcaption style="margin-left:8px;">The section of the quiz highlighted will be replaced by a timer in the weekly quizzes.</figcaption>

		</details>
		</div>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> Can I use my notes while taking the quiz? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> You have full access to any note you have taken as well as any relevant readings while taking the quiz, and are free to reference them during a quiz.</p>
			<p class=instruction> Keep in mind this doesn't mean you should only start reading the relevant quiz topics when you start it, as you still have that 90 minute time limit to complete the quiz.</p>
		</details>
		</div>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> What happens if I close the quiz in the middle of doing it? </b> </summary>

		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> When is each quiz due? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> Quizzes must be finished on a weekly basis and should be completed <b>before the start of the corresponding week's lab session.</b> It is recommended that you start them sometime after each lab session. In other words, you have <b>about a week</b> to complete each quiz.</p>
			<p class=instruction> For example, once your week 4 session has concluded, you must complete the week 5 readings quiz before the start of your week 5 lab session.</p>
		</details>

		<h2>Where to find quiz readings</h2>
		<p>Each quiz will have a set of readings associated with it that must be read in order to complete it.</p>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> Where can I find each week's corresponding readings? </b> </summary>
			<h3 style="margin-left:2px;">All readings can be found under their respective week's content tab. To access them, from your CMN300 homepage:</h3>
			<p class=instruction>1. Click on the "Content" tab near the top of the page. (Fig 7)</p>
			<p class=instruction>2. Scroll down the side tab until you find the week you are looking for. For the academic integrity refresher quiz, its readings are located in the <b>week 1 content tab.</b> (Fig 8)</p>
			<p class=instruction>3. The readings relevant to the quiz will generally be in the "Before class" section, numbered above the quiz's link. From this point, clicking a reading's link will either take you to the reading itself or to another page where you can access the reading. </p>
			<p class=instruction>Note: Because week 1 is structured differently, these examples <b>will not be completely accurate to what the actual readings may look like.</b> However, they should still be useful for locating where the weekly readings will likely be.</p>

			<summary> <b> What kinds of readings will be required? </b> </summary>
			<h3 style="margin-left:2px;"> There are 4 main types of content you may need to review for each quiz:</h3>
			<p class=instruction> - Articles, which are fairly short readings that can provide a summary, explanation, or definition of the week's topic.</p>
			<p class=instruction> - Videos, which are able to provide shorter, condensed explanations of the week's topic or aspects of the week's topic. </p>
			<p class=instruction> - Chapters/Chapter sections, which are longer, in-depth readings about the relevant topic that are sourced from textbooks and are provided to you through the library e-reserves tab (shown below).</p>
			<p class=instruction> - Samples/guides, which are meant for you to skim and provide additonal understanding of that week's topic.</p>

		</details>
		</div>
		<div class="contentbox">
		<details>
			<summary> <b> How long does it take to review the readings? </b> </summary>
			<p class=instruction> The readings should take maybe an hour to an hour and a half of your time to complete fully.</p>
			<p class=instruction> Keep in mind the required readings differ from week to week. One week might have 2 articles, a chapter, and a guide to skim while another week might only have a video and parts of a chapter required.</p>
			<p class=instruction> Each reading will also have an approximate length of time it'll take to complete right next to it.</p>
