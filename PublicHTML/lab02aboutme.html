		<h2> About Me </h2> 
		<p> Hello! My name is Angelo Dela Cruz. Since about the beginning of high school, I've had an interest in coding and computers in general, which led me to pursuing a degree
		in computer science at Toronto Metropolitan University. I was born here in Toronto on January 19th, 2003, and have lived here my whole life. </p>
		<p> I was raised alongside two younger siblings
		(born 2007 and 2009), and currently live with them, my mom, dad, and grandmother. Our parents were Catholic and had us all go to Catholic schools, however now I don't really consider myself particularly religious.
		I also did pretty well in school generally, and my marks tended to be around 85% for all of elementary and high school.</p>
		<p> Aside from computer science, my hobbies include playing video games, watching YouTube, writing (mostly for myself), and chatting/hanging out with friends.
		I'd say video games are probably the thing I'm most interested in, and the idea of making my own one day helped influence me to pursue computer science. The top 3 I'd consider I'm most into right now are Valorant,
		Dead by Daylight, and Terraria. </p>
