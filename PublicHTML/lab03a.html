		<h3 class=text> Akita Inu Trivia </h3>
		<p class=text> Akita Inus are the second most popular Japanese dog breed, only losing out to the Shiba Inu. Although they are known to be quite territorial and behave aggressively towards strangers, they are actually quite affectionate with children and are said to make strong bonds with them. Ancestors of the modern Akita Inu were brought along in hunting trips to help flush out game hiding. Today, they are popular as companions and as therapy dogs. </p>

		<h3 class=text> Karakachan Dog Trivia </h3>
		<p class=text> Karakachan dogs are shepherd dogs that originated from Bulgaria and are extremely brave and protective of livestock. Some have been seen to not hesitate at all when confronted by wolves, poachers, or even bears when defending their flock or family from danger! They are also named after a group of Greek nomadic shepherds called the Karakachans, and are related to all livestock guardian dogs in Romania, Macedonia, Serbia, Greece, and Turkey. </p>
